# Training workshop on *drjacoby* for Bayesian model fitting in R

This repos holds the material for a training workshop on *drjacoby*. The workshop covers the following topics:

- Getting *drjacoby* up and running with the correct input formats
- Producing basic plots of MCMC output and checking MCMC diagnostics
- Exploring model fit; credible intervals vs. posterior predictive checks
- Model comparison
- Linking with other packages, with the example of a compartmental model in *Odin*
- Using C++ functions to speed things up
- Activating parallel tempering to improve mixing and deal with multi-modality

## What to do before the workshop

Please install *drjacoby* ahead of the workshop so we can hit the ground running. This will also help identify any issues with installation so we can iron them out in a less pressured environment!
